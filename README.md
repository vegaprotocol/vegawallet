# Vega Wallet

`vegawallet` is the command line interface for running a Wallet service,
implemented in Go. It is used to sign transactions for use
on [Vega](#about-vega). Vega Wallet creates and manages HD wallets with ed25519
key pairs.

### ⚠️ [Learn how to install and run Vega Wallet (v 0.8.0) by clicking here to visit the docs site.](https://docs.fairground.vega.xyz/docs/wallet/getting-started/) 
 
## Building

```sh
cd go-wallet && make
```

Note: Building and compiling locally will install the wallet under the name
go-wallet, and not vegawallet. Thus, when reading the documentation,
replace `vegawallet` with `go-wallet`.

## Download

Download and save the zip file
from [Releases](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/go-wallet/releases). Keep track
of where you've saved the file, because that's where the CLI will look for it.

### MacOS

Download `vegawallet-darwin-amd64.zip`

When you open the file, you may need to change your system preferences for this
specific instance, in order to run Vega Wallet. If you open the file from
downloads, you may get a message saying:

> "vegawallet-darwin-amd64” cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified
> developer.

Click on the `(?)` help button, which will open a window that links you to the
`System Preferences`, and instructs you how to allow this software to run.

You’ll need to go to `System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General`, and
choose `Open Anyway`.

### Windows

Download `vegawallet-windows-amd64.zip`

You may need to change your system preferences for this specific instance, in
order to run Vega Wallet. If you open the file from downloads, you may get a
message from Windows Defender saying:

> "vegawallet-windows-amd64" cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified
> developer.

Click on the `(More info)` text, which will reveal a button to `Run anyway`.
